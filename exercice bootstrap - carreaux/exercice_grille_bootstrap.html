                                Like all good measurement, it should start with clear organizational objectives. Theses can come in many different forms.
                                Whether they be awareness, advocacy, adoption or demand related. Following on from organizational
                                objectives, is communication objectives. Theses should reflect and mirror the organinazational
                                objectives. Remember, the difference between an objective and a goal is that an objective
                                has a measure of impact (e.g. 20% increase in brand awareness), compared to a goal that is
                                an aspiration (e.g. increase brand awareness).

                                how many people attented the event, and how many potential readers of the media coverage.
